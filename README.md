  - Using **reduce** for sum, average, max/min.  
  - Boolean checks with **some** and **every**.  
  - Searching with **find** & **findIndex**.  
  - Sorting numbers, strings, and objects using **custom comparison**.

- **Total Questions:** 10  
- **What I Practiced:** Adding event listeners, using capturing vs bubbling, applying event delegation for efficiency, handling keyboard/mouse input, and working with forms dynamically.  
- **What I Learned:**  
  - Clear difference between **bubbling** and **capturing**.  
  - How to use **delegation** for dynamic elements.  
  - Generating **random colors** with events.  
  - Preventing **form reload** and showing success messages.

- **Total Projects:** 4  
- **What I Practiced:** Building interactive mini apps using DOM manipulation, handling click & input events, dynamically creating/removing elements, and toggling CSS classes.  
- **What I Learned:**
